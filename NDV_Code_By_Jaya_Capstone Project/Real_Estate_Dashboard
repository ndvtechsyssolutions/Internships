Project Overview
A fun and beginner-friendly Streamlit web app that predicts house prices based on neighborhood and housing features. It uses a Random Forest regression model trained on the Boston Housing dataset.

Objective
To help even a 10-year-old understand how features like rooms, pollution, taxes, and schools affect property price — and to predict the price in Indian Rupees (₹).

How to Use
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Train the model:
python model_train.py

Launch the app:
streamlit run app.py

Inputs Explained
Input	What it Means
Crime Rate	Safety of neighborhood
Rooms	Size of house
Air Quality	Pollution level
Distance to Amenities	Access to shops/schools
Taxes, Diversity, River, etc.	Area features

Each input is explained clearly using ranges (e.g., “0 = safe”, “10 = many rooms”).

Output
The app shows predicted home price in INR, e.g.:
Your predicted house price is: ₹ 45,23,120.00
