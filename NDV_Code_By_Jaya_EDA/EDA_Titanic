Project Summary â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset
This project performs a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns and insights about passenger survival during the historic maritime disaster. The dataset includes demographic, class, fare, and survival information for passengers.

âœ… Key Steps Performed
Data Loading

Loaded the Titanic dataset (tested.csv) using Pandas.

Data Cleaning

Handled missing values in Age and Embarked.

Dropped the Cabin column due to excessive nulls.

Removed duplicate records.

Summary Statistics

Used info(), describe(), and value_counts() for structural insights.

Visualizations

Plotted histograms (Age), box plots (Age vs Pclass), and count plots (Survival vs Sex).

Used violin plots to show survival trends by class and age.

Generated a pair plot and correlation heatmap to study variable relationships.

Group Analysis

Used groupby() to compare survival rates across gender and passenger class.

Feature Engineering

Created a new FamilySize column (SibSp + Parch + 1) to evaluate family impact on survival.

Top 5 Insights Documented

Listed major findings from the analysis in markdown for interpretability.

ðŸŒŸ Top 5 Insights
Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.

First-class passengers were more likely to survive than lower classes.

Younger children had higher survival odds.

Small family sizes (2â€“4) improved chances of survival.

Higher ticket fares correlated with better survival likelihood.

ðŸ§© Tools Used
Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Pandas, NumPy
