# 🧾 Assignment 1 – Student Record Management Console App (AIML)

This is a console-based **Python application** developed as part of my internship at **NDV Techsys**, submitted under the `Internships` GitHub repository.

It allows basic **student record management** using a simple menu-driven interface in the terminal. The app demonstrates the use of Python lists, dictionaries, functions, and user input handling.
