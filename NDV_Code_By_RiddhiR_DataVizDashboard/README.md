This project is an interactive data visualization dashboard built with Streamlit. It allows users to:
- Upload and explore CSV datasets,
- Filter data with sliders and dropdowns,
- View summary statistics,
- Visualize data using multiple charts (histogram, boxplot, line chart, pie chart),
- Download filtered data as a CSV file.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Upload your own CSV files using the sidebar.  
✅ If no file is uploaded, loads a default sample_data.csv.  
✅ Choose numeric columns to analyze with filters and summary statistics.

- Line chart
- (Optional) Pie chart for categorical data

✅ Download the filtered data as a new CSV.
