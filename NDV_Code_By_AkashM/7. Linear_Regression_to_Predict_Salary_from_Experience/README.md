    -Salary_Prediction.ipynb
     Full code for loading data, EDA, training, prediction, and evaluation.

    -salary.csv
     Dataset with YearsExperience and Salary columns from Kaggle.

🔧 Steps Performed

    1. Data Loading
    Imported libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn.

    Uploaded and loaded salary.csv.

    Displayed dataset preview and summary stats.

    2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    Visualized Years of Experience vs Salary with scatter plot 📊.

    Observed strong positive linear correlation.

    3. Data Preparation
    Split data into features (YearsExperience) and target (Salary).

    Created train/test split (80% train, 20% test) 🎯.

    4. Model Training
    Trained a Linear Regression model on training data 🏋️‍♂️.

    5. Model Prediction & Evaluation
    Predicted salary on test data.

    Calculated Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score for accuracy.

    Plotted regression line over actual data points 🔴.

    6. Interactive Prediction
    Took user input for years of experience and predicted salary 💡.

    7. Actual vs Predicted Comparison
    Visualized actual vs predicted salaries with bar chart 📉.

📊 Key Outputs

    Scatter plot showing clear trend between experience and salary.

    Regression line fitting data well.

    MSE and R² showing strong model performance.

    Interactive prediction output for custom input.

    Bar chart comparing actual and predicted salaries.

🚀 How to Run

    Open Salary_Prediction.ipynb.

    Upload salary.csv.

    Run cells step-by-step.

    Enter experience when prompted for salary prediction.

✅ Outcomes

    Built a model that predicts salary based on experience with solid accuracy 🎯.

    Visualizations that explain relationships and model fit.

    Easy user input to get salary predictions instantly.

💡 Future Improvements

    Try polynomial regression for nonlinear patterns 🔄.

    Add more features like education, role, location 🌎.

    Use cross-validation to improve evaluation 📈.
