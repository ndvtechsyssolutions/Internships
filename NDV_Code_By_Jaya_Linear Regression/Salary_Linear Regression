Summary of Assignment 6: Linear Regression for Predicting Salary
Objective:
To build a simple linear regression model using Python that predicts an employee's salary based on their years of experience.

Dataset Used:
Name: salary_data.csv

Columns:

YearsExperience – independent variable (X)

Salary – dependent variable (y)

Steps Performed:
Data Loading:

Loaded CSV using Pandas.

Data Visualization:

Created a scatter plot to observe the relationship between experience and salary.

Train-Test Split:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets (80% train, 20% test).

Model Training:

Applied Linear Regression using scikit-learn.

Prediction:

Predicted salaries on the test set.

Evaluation:

Evaluated model using:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R² Score

Plotting Regression Line:

Visualized how well the model fits the data.

Bonus Features:
Comparison Plot:

Bar chart showing actual vs predicted salaries.

User Input Prediction:

Allowed user to input years of experience and get a salary prediction.

Model Results (Sample):
Intercept: ~25,000

Coefficient: ~9,000 per year of experience

R² Score: ~0.95 (indicates excellent fit)

Conclusion:
The regression model effectively captures the linear relationship between experience and salary, making it a reliable tool for salary prediction in this dataset.
