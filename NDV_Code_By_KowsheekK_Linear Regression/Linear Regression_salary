Title: Linear Regression for Predicting Salary from Years of Experience

Goal:
To build and evaluate a simple linear regression model in Python that predicts an employee’s salary based on their years of experience.

Tasks Involved
Data Loading & Exploration:

Use a dataset (salary_data.csv) containing YearsExperience and Salary.

Explore structure and basic statistics using Pandas.

Visualization:

Plot a scatter graph to visualize the relationship between experience and salary.

Model Building:

Split data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20).

Train a simple linear regression model using sklearn.

Evaluation:

Predict salaries for the test set.

Evaluate performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score.

Plot the regression line.

Bonus Tasks
Add error bars to show prediction confidence.

Create a bar chart comparing actual vs predicted values.

Allow user input to predict salary for custom years of experience.
