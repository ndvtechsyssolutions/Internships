# Loan Default Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning

##  Objective
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning classification model that can predict whether a customer is likely to **default on a loan**. This helps financial institutions make data-driven decisions for loan approvals.

##  Dataset
The dataset used is uploaded from a CSV file named `3055fc12-4302-4fa2-b386-02bafce87765.csv`.

###  Features:
- Numerical and categorical columns (details depend on your dataset).
- The target column is assumed to be `default` (binary: 0 = no default, 1 = default).

---

## Data Preprocessing
- **Missing Values:** Dropped rows with missing values.
- **Categorical Encoding:** One-hot encoding used for categorical columns.
- **Feature Scaling:** StandardScaler used for normalizing numerical data.
- **Train-Test Split:** Dataset split into 80% training and 20% testing.

##  Models Used
Three classification models were trained and evaluated:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier

---

## Evaluation Metrics
Each model was evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1-Score**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **ROC Curve and AUC Score**

---

## Hyperparameter Tuning (Bonus)
Used `GridSearchCV` to tune the Decision Tree Classifier:
```python
param_grid = {
    'max_depth': [3, 5, 10],
    'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10]
}
