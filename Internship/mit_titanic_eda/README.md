# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset

This project performs comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. 

The goal is to understand the dataset's structure, clean it, handle missing values, and uncover insights into the factors that influenced survival rates through various visualizations.

### Key Findings and Interpretations:

**Overall Survival Rate:**

Less than half of the passengers survived the disaster, indicating a high fatality rate.

**Embarked Location:** 

Most passengers embarked from location 2.0 (likely Southampton), while location 1.0 had the least number of embarked passengers. 

When examining survival by embarkment point, location 2.0 also had the most casualties, though survival rates were generally low across all embarkation points.

**Age Distribution:** 

The highest concentration of passengers was around 28 years old. 

The number of passengers significantly decreased for ages above 60, indicating fewer elderly individuals on board.

**Age Group and Survival:**

Children (Age Group 0) had a higher survival rate compared to other age groups.

Young Adults (Age Group 1) had the highest casualty count, likely due to being the largest demographic.

**Sex and Survival:**

Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males. 

**Passenger Class (Pclass) and Survival:**

Passenger Class 1 (First Class) had the highest survival rate, indicating that social status or location on the ship played a crucial role in survival.

Passenger Class 3 (Third Class) had the highest casualty count and the lowest survival rate, suggesting that passengers in lower classes had significantly fewer chances of survival.

**Family Size and Survival:**

Passengers with small family sizes (2-4 members) had a higher chance of survival.

Passengers traveling alone or with very large families (more than 5 members) had a lower survival rate. This could be due to single individuals having no one to help them, and very large families struggling to evacuate together.
